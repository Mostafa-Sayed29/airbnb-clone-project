# airbnb-clone-project
## üìå Project Overview
This project is a clone of the AirBnB web platform. It is part of the ALX Software Engineering curriculum and focuses on building a full-stack web application from the ground up. The goal is to understand how front-end and back-end systems interact, and to practice coding with scalability, maintainability, and clarity in mind.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack
- **Python** ‚Äî for backend logic
- **Flask** ‚Äî lightweight web framework
- **HTML/CSS** ‚Äî for UI structure and styling
- **JavaScript** ‚Äî for dynamic front-end behavior
- **MySQL** ‚Äî for data storage
- **Git & GitHub** ‚Äî for version control and collaboration

## üöÄ Project Goals
- Recreate the core functionalities of the AirBnB platform
- Practice working with databases, user authentication, and APIs
- Build out a scalable codebase and apply clean code principles
- Collaborate with peers using Git and GitHub
## üé® UI/UX Design Planning

### üß≠ Design Goals
Our goal is to deliver an intuitive, accessible, and visually appealing interface that mimics the user experience of Airbnb while keeping performance and responsiveness in mind. The design must:
- Be **simple and easy to navigate**
- Be **mobile-responsive**
- Guide the user smoothly from browsing to booking
- Support **quick decision-making** with clear visuals and CTAs (calls to action)

### üîë Key Features
- Clean navigation with filters and search
- Highlighted images for properties
- Quick info previews and pricing
- Booking flow with minimal clicks
- Responsive layout for desktop and mobile

### üìÑ Main Pages Overview

| Page | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **üèòÔ∏è Property Listing View** | Displays a list/grid of available properties. Includes thumbnails, pricing, and location. Users can filter by date, location, price, and more. |
| **üìã Listing Detailed View** | Shows full property details including images, amenities, reviews, host info, and a "Book Now" button. Enables trust through detailed presentation. |
| **üí≥ Simple Checkout View** | Allows users to confirm their booking. Includes date selection, payment details, total price breakdown, and a final confirmation button. |

### üí° Why User-Friendly Design Matters

In a booking system like this, **user-friendliness directly impacts conversion rates**. If a user struggles to find a property, read information, or complete a booking, they are likely to abandon the process. A well-thought-out design ensures:
- **Reduced friction** in navigation and booking
- **Increased trust** with clean and consistent UI
- **Faster decisions** from clear layouts and CTAs
- **Better mobile usability** ‚Äî crucial for travel apps

Creating a frictionless experience is essential to encouraging user engagement and satisfaction.
### üé® Figma Design Properties

Below is a list of the core design properties observed from the Figma mockup:

#### üñåÔ∏è Color Styles
- **Primary Color:** #FF5A5F (Airbnb Red)
- **Secondary Color:** #484848 (Dark Gray)
- **Accent Color:** #00A699 (Teal)
- **Background Color:** #FFFFFF (White)
- **Light Gray:** #F7F7F7
- **Border Color:** #DDDDDD

#### üî† Typography

| Style         | Font Family       | Font Weight | Font Size |
|---------------|-------------------|-------------|-----------|
| Headings (H1) | Circular Std      | Bold        | 32px      |
| Subheadings   | Circular Std      | Medium      | 24px      |
| Body Text     | Circular Std      | Regular     | 16px      |
| Captions      | Circular Std      | Light       | 12px      |

> *Note:* If Circular Std is unavailable, you can use system-safe fallbacks like **Helvetica**, **Arial**, or **Sans-serif**.

### üîç Why Identifying Design Properties Matters

Understanding the design properties from the Figma mockup ensures **consistency and accuracy** when translating designs into code. Here‚Äôs why it‚Äôs important:
- Ensures that **colors, fonts, and layout** remain visually aligned with the design system
- Helps developers maintain **UI consistency** across all pages
- Makes future collaboration between designers and developers smoother
- Allows faster prototyping and implementation
- Improves accessibility and responsiveness across devices

By referencing specific design tokens (colors, fonts, spacing), we bridge the gap between UI design and code implementation more effectively.
